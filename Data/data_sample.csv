(i) A weak metric $f$-structure $({f},Q,\xi_i,\eta^i,g)$ is called a \textit{weak ${K}$-structure} if it is normal and
%the form $\Phi$ is closed, i.e.,
$d \Phi=0$. We define two subclasses of weak ${K}$-manifolds
as follows:

(ii) \textit{weak ${\cal C}$-manifolds} if $d\eta^i = 0$ for any $i$, and

(iii) \textit{weak ${\cal S}$-manifolds} if the following is valid:

\begin{align}\label{2.3}

Omitting the normality condition, we get the following: a weak metric $f$-structure is called

(i)~a \textit{weak almost ${\cal K}$-structure} if $d\Phi=0$;

(ii)~a \textit{weak almost ${\cal C}$-structure} if $\Phi$ and $\eta^i\ (1\le i\le s)$ are closed forms;

(iii)~a \textit{weak almost ${\cal S}$-structure} if \eqref{2.3} is valid (hence, $d\Phi=0$).
